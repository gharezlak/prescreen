This is a recruiting productivity tool that creates and stores forms used in recruiting prescreens. 

It also has a dashboard used to draw a signal on which questions are providing meaningful results.

This tool is built using the Meteor framework (Node.js, MongoDB and Spacebars)

The code base is a mess, there's no documentation, and stylistically it's all over the place. If anyone has comments, or wants to fork and clean it up, I'd be grateful for the assistance :)
